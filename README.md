# -SALES-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD-IMPLEMENTATION
1. Introduction

This project uses Power BI Desktop to analyze company sales and profit data across different categories, regions, and time periods. The goal was to transform raw data into interactive dashboards, enabling quick insights into performance metrics such as sales, profit, and quantity sold.

2. Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle to track performance across multiple dimensions—products, regions, and time. Without proper visualization, it becomes difficult to identify:

Which categories contribute most to sales and profit.

Regional strengths and weaknesses.

Monthly or yearly profit trends.

Customer preferences in shipping modes.

The challenge was to design a dashboard that provides clear, actionable insights.

3. Skills and Tools Demonstrated

Data Visualization with Power BI: Building dashboards and reports.

Data Modeling: Cleaning and structuring data for analysis.

Interactive Filters: Allowing users to explore by year, quarter, and region.

KPI Tracking: Sales (887.92K), Profit (108.80K), Quantity (15.24K).

Visuals Used: Bar charts, line charts, maps, and KPI cards.

4. Analysis of the Project

Category Performance: Technology and Office Supplies generated higher profits compared to Furniture.

Regional Insights: Highest profits came from cities like New York (31.11K) and California (30.17K).

Time Trends: Profit fluctuated across months, with some peak periods (e.g., November–December likely higher due to seasonal sales).

Shipping Mode: Standard class dominated with 55.82% of usage, showing customer preference for cost-effective delivery.

Discount Impact: Discounts were minimal (0.63K), showing that profitability was maintained without heavy reliance on price cuts.
